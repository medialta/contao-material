Contao Material is a back-end theme for Contao Open Source CMS. It is inspired by Google Material Design guidelines.

# Installation

Contao Material is a back-end theme for Contao, but it is basically a module. So, you'll have to install it like a module, in the `/system/modules` directory.

It is recommended that you download the release corresponding to your version of Contao. You can still install a release more recent but it may not work properly. We recommend updating Contao before installing or updating Contao Material.

## Installation with Contao Composer client (recommended)
This method should be preferred because it facilitates updates.

### Prerequisites
In order to install this theme with the Composer client, you have to enable it. Two options for that:
 - Install it from the Contao installation tool (`/contao/install.php`)
 - Download the Composer client directly from Contao: `/contao/main.php?do=repository_catalog&view=composer`

Once the installation starts, follow the steps until you see **Package Management** in the modules menu.

### Contao Material installation
Now you have the Composer client, you can search for **medialta/contao-material** in the Package Management module.

**Be sure to install our module and not a fork if you want to have the last updates**.

After that, you just have to select the release you want to install and hit the **Update packages** button on the Composer client's homepage.

## Installation with Zip file
 - Download the release you want to install from [https://github.com/medialta/contao-material/releases](https://github.com/medialta/contao-material/releases)
 - Extract the compressed file in `/system/modules/`
 - Rename the folder to `contao-material` (remove the release version)
